#### Identifying the landing position of the image : Rheumatoid Arthritis application

### Dataset
Characteristics and definition - what the dataset has and what it does not have.
   1. Preprocessing dataset: Data augmentation, also understanding more on hand to understand results, edge cases
      1. Expanding dataset (via data augmentation techniques with skin color)
   2. Discuss processing architecture : 
   3. Train the model - divide training, validation etc. 
   4. Fine tune the parameters and iterate

   Define knowledge into the system.
   Also we need to come up with 
   Get an image -> 
   Is the image good -> 
   Preprocess the image for inputs to the algorithm -> 
   __Process with learned model__ -> 
   __Compute landing position__ -> 
   __Check if the answer is correct__
